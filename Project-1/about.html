              <h3>Our Origins</h3>  
              <p>Founded in 1866 by Dr. J.W. Lyon's, D.D.S., our company began as a small dental practice in New York dedicated to improving everyday oral hygiene. Dr. Lyon's developed his tooth powder after years of treating patients who struggled with the traditional abrasive cleaners and unreliable cork topped jars.</p>
              <p>Dr. Lyon's Tooth Powder had become a trusted household name, known for its fine texture, refreshing taste, and reliable cleaning. The product was later manufactured under the R.L. Watkins Company, a division of Sterling Drug Inc., enabling wider distribution.</p>
